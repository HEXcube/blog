The easiest method to install Flutter or Dart on Ubuntu is to use the officially recommended [Ubuntu Make snap](https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-make). No need to download Flutter as zip, try to [manually install it](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux), add PPAs or fiddle with PATHs. Ubuntu Make'll automatically download the latest Flutter SDK, install it along with all the necessary dependencies and setup the correct PATH variables.

Step 1: Install Ubuntu Make snap
-------------
Run this command:

    snap install --classic ubuntu-make

Step 2: Install Flutter SDK
-------------

    umake dart flutter-sdk

Step 3: Install Android Studio

Step 4: Install an editor

That's all folks! You got everything installed on your Ubuntu machine to develop Flutter apps. üëçüèº
