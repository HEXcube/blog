I've been planning to create a blog for a long time, but never found the time to do it. Today I finally went ahead and did it! I followed this guide - [Five Minutes to Your Own Website](https://towardsdatascience.com/five-minutes-to-your-own-website-fd0b43cbd886), and forked the Jekyll Now repo mentioned there to quickly setup this blog.

I modified the the provided Hello World markdown file in /_posts/ and easily converted it into this post. For more instructions, head over to [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
