I've been planning to create a blog for a long time, but never found the time to do it. Today I finally went ahead and did it!ðŸ˜ƒ I followed this guide - [Five Minutes to Your Own Website](https://towardsdatascience.com/five-minutes-to-your-own-website-fd0b43cbd886), and forked the [Jekyll Now repo](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) mentioned there to quickly setup this blog.

I modified the the provided Hello World markdown file in ```/_posts/``` and easily converted it into this post. For more detailed instructions on how to start your own blog on GitHub Pages, head over to this article: [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages).
