title: How I enabled "Google Play Services for AR" on my Mi A2
---

[Google Play Services for AR (previously ARcore)](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover) is Google's platform for AR apps. It's supported on most developer friendly Android devices. However, Mi A2, despite being an Android One device, haven't gotten ARcore support yet. :disappointed: But there's a way to enable ARcore unofficially on most Android phones with capable hardware.

Step 1: Enable Camera2 API
-------------
Follow this guide to temporarily root your phone and enable Camera2 API: https://www.thecustomdroid.com/enable-camera2-api-xiaomi-mi-a2-lite-guide/

Step 2: Install Google Camera (Optional)
-------------
An added benefit of enabling Camera2 API is access to Google Camera. The official Google Camera on Play Store is available only for Pixel devices. So, you'll have to sideload a mod of Google Camera for your device. Try one of the apk builds from these Google Camera mods optimized for Mi A2: https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/dev-the_dise/

Step 3: Enable Google Play Services for AR (ARcore)

If you installed Google Camera in Step 2, you can install Google Playground addon for it and play with AR stickers. Sideload Playground mod from here: https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/ar/
